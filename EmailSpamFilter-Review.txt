# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Filter â€“ Neural Network from Scratch

A binary email spam classifier built entirely from scratch using **NumPy** for matrix operations â€” no machine learning libraries involved.

This project demonstrates how a simple feedforward neural network can perform surprisingly well with careful design and training, even on a small dataset.

- âœ… **Training Accuracy**: 95.60%  
- âœ… **Testing Accuracy**: 94.00%

## ðŸ§  Neural Network Architecture

The model is a fully connected feedforward neural network with:

- **Input Layer**: 54 nodes (preprocessed features)  
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 64 nodes â€“ ReLU activation  
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 32 nodes â€“ ReLU activation  
- **Output Layer**: 1 node â€“ Sigmoid activation

## ðŸ”„ Forward Propagation

Each layer computes:

Z = W Â· X + b
A = activation(Z)

Where:

- `W` = weights  
- `X` = input from previous layer  
- `b` = bias  
- `A` = activated output

### ReLU â€“ Rectified Linear Unit (Hidden Layers)

Introduces non-linearity and helps avoid vanishing gradients:
