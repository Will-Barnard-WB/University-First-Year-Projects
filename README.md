## 📂 Project List

### 1. 📧 Email Spam Filter
**Tech:** Python, Neural Networks  
**Description:** A simple spam classifier using a feedforward neural network trained on labeled email data. Focuses on preprocessing text data and applying basic machine learning principles.

---

### 2. 🔢 Sudoku Solver
**Tech:** Python, CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), Backtracking DFS  
**Description:** Solves any valid Sudoku board using constraint propagation and backtracking. Includes support for visualizing steps and heuristic optimization (e.g., MRV, forward checking).

---

### 3. 🧮 RPN Calculator (Reverse Polish Notation)
**Tech:** Possibly a simple Compiler or Stack-based Interpreter (language TBD)  
**Description:** Evaluates arithmetic expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation. May be extended to parse and compile infix to postfix expressions.

---

### 4. 🎲 Dice Game Solver
**Tech:** Python, Markov Decision Process, Value Iteration  
**Description:** Uses value iteration to compute an optimal policy in a custom dice game scenario. Demonstrates understanding of reinforcement learning fundamentals and stochastic planning.

---

### 5. ☕ Java File Reader
**Tech:** Java, Multithreading  
**Description:** A multithreaded Java application that reads and processes large text files concurrently. Showcases synchronization and efficient I/O handling.

---

### 6. 💬 Simple SMS App
**Tech:** Python or Java (TBD), Client/Server Architecture  
**Description:** A basic messaging system with client-server communication over sockets. Supports simple text message exchange and user session management.
